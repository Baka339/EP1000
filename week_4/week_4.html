        <p>For Week 4 I was taught Computer Aided Design or CAD. Its used to design 2D or 3D objects. The program I used is Fusion 360 which is a cloud based CAD tool. It combines organic, mechanical design together. 
        <p>Our task this week is to try and replcate the 3 designs given. Had some problems with the last one but I managed to figure it out after watching the videos and asking my friends from other courses for help.</p>
        <p>I had to create a name tag this week. So the tools that I needed to use was extrude and to thing how to create a shape and to trim to create it. While extruding also the name tag should be able to see my initials. Still having a little bit of space to play I added a smily face. It was a enjoyable process in what I needed to do.</p>
