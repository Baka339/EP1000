        <p>Hi, In the first week of the lesson I learn about the basic safety and procedure of Fablab. I was given a brief introducion to what this module will be about as well as also the tools needed to complete it at the end of the term. I needed to think about my final project for next semester. I thought on a macro key pad or a music box. </p>
        <p>Had an introduction in design prototyping and I had to sketch a design of a phone holder. The first is that I try to design one base of the web or copying someone else and the second is my own design. After designing I had to think of the different views and what dimensions I can give them. Doing that gave me an idea of how to start a basic design. </p>
