        <p>For my final project i wanted to do a simple present that people could give to their friends or loved ones. Its suppose to be simple enough to fix and also to be customisable. Below are the sketchs that I drew while thinking about my final product. There were minor changes to the end product but my sketch helped me with an idea to start with. </p>
        <p> After finishing my final sketch that I wanted, I took to fusion 360 to start designing the box. Had to take some measurements because I wanted to add a music player inside and a small circuit box too so that when you open that box it would light up. The box will consist of 2 compartments the bottom mainly to hold the circuit while also acting as a sercert space to keep some small personal items while the top is the main compartment to store the main stuff. Also I 3d printed a hinge for the box so it would open and close.</p>
