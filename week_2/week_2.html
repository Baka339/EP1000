        <p>In week 2, I learned about project management and how I am going to divide my last 4 weeks to create and design my product. The other thing that the lecturer went through is about creating a website using HTML and CSS. A brief intro about HTML is that its a Hyertext Markup Language (HTML), its the standard markup language for documents designed for web brower. While CSS is the language for presenting web pages, it has colours, layout and fonts. Just there to make you HTML look better. </p>
        <p>What I used to edit the text is Sublime text editor. Its a text editor that has some useful fuctions for beginners like me. </p> 
        <p> It was my first time touching HTML and CSS and it was pretty hard to grasp it at first. After watching and trying the codes out it slowly came to me on how to go about doing this website and making it look "nice".</p>
