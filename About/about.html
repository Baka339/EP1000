        <p>Hi I'm Waikin, and I live in the North area of Singapore. I'm from Singapore Polytechnic studying Maritime Business as a course for my diploma.</p>
        <p> I choose Digital Fabrication & Prototyping because it seems cool. I'm the type of person that enjoys technology and creating things. As someone that took D&T in secondary school i really enjoyed the process of thinking and conceptualize an idea and try to turn it into a product. As someone who took part in a contest back in higher nitec where I had to design and build a boat from scratch, it intrigued me of what this module teaches.</p>
